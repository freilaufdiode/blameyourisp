# Blame your ISP
blameyourisp is a simple tool which makes a speedtest every 15 minutes and plots a graph to visualize your ISP's performance, helpful to spot deviations of your internet speed based on certain daytimes.

## Software Dependencies
* [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli)
* bash with GNU coreutils
* make
* python (>2.7 or 3.x)
* python-matplotlib
* python-dateutil
* python-setuptools

### optional Dependencies
* wget (for isp detection via [ip-api.com](http://ip-api.com))
* python-numpy (for some statistical values)
* python-pytz or python-tzlocal (for timezone detection)

## Hardware Dependencies
A unix machine with appropriate uptime, connected via cable to your router/modem.

## Setup
most dependencies should be met by your distributions package management system, others can be installed with pip.

Download the sourcecode and run `make install` as root.

blameyourisp does not ship with an init-script, but you could start it manually in the background:  
`nohup blameyourisp > /dev/null 2>&1 &`  
or put it in your /etc/rc.local (systemd users see [here](http://superuser.com/questions/278396/systemd-does-not-run-etc-rc-local)):  
`su - USER -c blameyourisp &`  
(replace USER by your own username)  
or, additionally to above suggestions, launch it with screen or tmux  

## Usage
Once set up correctly, results from speedtests will be recorded in ~/.blameyourisp/blameyourisp.log. After each test, a new plot will be saved to ~/blameyourisp.png

## Bugs
blameyourisp is beta software and has not yet been tested exhaustively. If you experience any issues, or have any suggestions/ideas/questions/whatever, do not hesitate to contact me!

## Notes
* Speedtests are influenced by active traffic (downloads, streams, etc). Traffic generated by flatmates also impacts speedtest results!
* Use a LAN-cable instead of a wireless connection for accurate results.
* Dont run multiple instances of blameyourisp in the same network.
* When using on mobile computers, stop the tool when you leave your home.
